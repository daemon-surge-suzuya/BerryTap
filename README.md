# BerryTap
This Python project provides an encoder and decoder implementation for text messages. 
The primary purpose of this project is to transform a given text message into an encoded form and then decode it back to its 
original content using a unique key. The encoding process involves generating random characters based on a provided seed and a 
character map, while the decoding process utilizes a predefined character map to revert the encoded message to its original form.
This project is useful for illustrating fundamental encoding concepts and decoding processes, aiding in comprehension of data transformation and security mechanisms in various applications such as cryptography and encoding schemes etc.

# Features
- Encode text messages using a random character mapping algorithm.
- Decode encoded messages using a pre-generated character map.

# Acknowledgments
The project structure and implementation were inspired by the need to showcase encoding and decoding techniques.
